# Frontend Mentor - Huddle Landing Page with Alternating Feature Blocks Solution

This is my solution to the [Huddle landing page with alternating feature blocks challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-alternating-feature-blocks-5ca5f5981e82137ec91a5100). It helped me sharpen my layout and responsive design skills using Tailwind CSS and semantic HTML5.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Git & GitHub

### What I Learned

While working on this project, I improved how I manage responsive layouts using Tailwind‚Äôs utility classes. I also got better at alternating content blocks using `flex-col-reverse` and `md:flex-row` ‚Äî super useful for these types of layout patterns.

```html
<div class="flex flex-col-reverse items-center gap-10 md:flex-row">
  <div class="md:w-1/2">Text content</div>
  <div class="md:w-1/2"><img src="./images/..." /></div>
</div>
```

I also learned to avoid accidental `node_modules` scanning in Tailwind by using specific `content` paths in `tailwind.config.js` for better performance.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Integrate animation libraries like AOS or GSAP for scroll effects
- Improve accessibility with landmarks and keyboard focus
- Explore more advanced layouts using CSS Grid with Tailwind

### Useful Resources

- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) ‚Äì For all utility classes
